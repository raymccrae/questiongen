The “New Party”, soon to be known by the exotic name of “Squadrone Volante”, had emerged out of the Country Party in 1704. As events were to prove, this group of around two dozen members was to have a key role in the outcome of the union vote. Crucial in carrying the treaty as a whole was Article XV, which dealt with the “Equivalent”. This was an attractive inducement to the Squadrone Volante, the small party whose support the Court Party had to retain in order to achieve ultimate success, so finely balanced was the overall position in Parliament. Some of the Equivalent was to be used to compensate the investors in the ill-fated Darien Company. Among the most significant of these were members of the Squadrone. The formidable political management machine of the Court Party contrasted with the disarray of the parliamentary opposition.
