Mary of Guise died shortly after midnight on 11 June 1560. Elizabeth I had already sent William Cecil to Newcastle to negotiate with French envoys and he now moved to Edinburgh. A truce was arranged between England and France and the Treaty of Edinburgh was signed on 6 July. The principal clause stated that all foreign soldiers were to withdraw from Scotland. Francis II and Mary, Queen of Scots, would henceforth abstain from displaying the English arms with those of Scotland. Since the Scots had spontaneously and freely professed and acknowledged their obedience and loyalty towards their most Christian king and queen, Francis and Mary would fulfil all their obligations in the treaty. Everything relating to religion would be referred to the Scots Parliament, and after the treaty had been signed John Knox held a great service of thanksgiving in St Giles.
