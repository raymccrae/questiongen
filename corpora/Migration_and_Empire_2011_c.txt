The vast majority of Scots who emigrated to New Zealand came from around Edinburgh or Glasgow, playing important roles in her economic development. Not surprisingly, the Dunedin entrepreneurs, like the clothing magnates John Ross and Robert Glendinning, or the Burt Brothers who established a nationwide plumbing firm, were Scottish. Scots were also over-represented among those noted for their contribution to education and even more strongly among those involved in science and health. Otago saw the first high school for girls open in 1871 thanks to the daughter of an iron-merchant from Angus—the first headmistress was also a Scot! The Scottish education system of 1872 was the model for New Zealand’s Education Act of 1877 and the fact that Otago had for a long time the only medical school in the country, and the strong links that school established with Edinburgh, helps to explain the continuing impact of Scots-born people in both the health and scientific fields.
