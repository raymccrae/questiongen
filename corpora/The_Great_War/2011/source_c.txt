The Clyde in 1913 launched 750,000 tons of shipping but by the end of the 1920s the Clyde was launching merely 56,000 tons of shipping, and 69 per cent of insured workers in the Scottish shipbuilding trade were unemployed. In 1913 Scotland manufactured about one fifth of the U.K.â€™s steel output and employed 140,000 miners but 20 years later the coal industry was finding work for only 80,000 hands and producing a third less coal. In 1913 Scottish unemployment was well below 10% but in the 1920s it never fell below 10%. The Dundee jute trade was deeply depressed and the Borders woollen industry for the greater part of the year was on part-time working. In the late 1920s the value of Scottish farming was falling while it was still rising in England, and in the fishing industry the numbers of those employed and the value of the catch were both steadily dropping.
