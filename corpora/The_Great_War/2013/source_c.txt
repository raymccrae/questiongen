Within a day of the declaration of war, the recruiting office in Edinburgh’s Cockburn Street was doing brisk business and, by the end of August 20,000 recruits had been processed. In Glasgow six thousand men enlisted over the very first weekend of war and from across Scotland came news of equally high figures. However, the number of volunteers began to fall off in 1915. There were increasing concerns that compulsory military service would be introduced and anti-conscription rallies had been held in Glasgow since the end of 1915, one meeting being addressed by committed anti-war protestors Sylvia Pankhurst and John MacLean. The National Registration Act of July 1915 required all persons to register for possible service which helped to maintain the Liberals’ belief in the voluntary principle as most Scottish Liberal MPs were opposed to conscription. The national registration scheme however proved to be cumbersome and unworkable and recruitment continued to fall and, though long resisted, compulsory service became inevitable resulting in the Military Services Act of 1916.
