The violence was touched off by the outnumbered and understandably nervous police who charged with batons raised to try to clear the tramlines. It continued with blows landing indiscriminately on both strikers and curious bystanders. Gallacher’s horrified reaction was to try to get the crowd to disperse. Kirkwood was trying to pacify the crowd when he was beaten to the ground by police truncheons. He was later able to provide photographic evidence of this and was found not guilty while William Gallacher and Emanuel Shinwell were each sentenced to five months imprisonment for “incitement to riot”. However, the “riot” in George Square was not planned; the situation was simply misread and violence erupted, but not because of a revolutionary plot. Thousands of people had been brought together through fears of unemployment and high prices but the government, plagued by fears of communism, seems to have taken the possibility of revolution seriously.
