The immediate reaction to union in Scotland was far from favourable, with growing resentment at breaches in the spirit of the treaty and delays in paying the Equivalent. Increased duties and an attempt to impose the malt tax led to an effort by Scottish MPs to reverse the union in 1713, and their proposal was hotly debated in parliament. However the union survived and endured, as Scottish landowners and merchants realised that Empire presented them with a golden opportunity for personal advancement and learned the ways of enterprise. Association with Englandâ€™s military force allowed for continuing prosperity and free access to the largest commercial market then on offer. Overseas trade opened up opportunities for Scots through colonies.
