Dundee developed a way of turning jute fibre from Bengal into a useable cloth. As a result a handful of families made huge profits exporting jute sacking to the Empire. The display of their wealth and confidence can be seen in the growth of elegant suburbs such as at Broughty Ferry near Dundee. Money from the Empire also helped some landed families who were struggling in Scotland’s rural economy. For example, money from the Indian textile trade was used by Alisdair Forbes to purchase and improve country estates in the Strathdon area. However, once the Empire developed its own industries, they became serious competitors for Scottish producers. The First World War saw a boom in Scottish industry. Dundee’s jute mills worked hard producing sand bags as well as tent material. However, even by 1914 Bengal jute mills were making huge profits. Prices for jute fell after the war and employment levels in the jute industry in Scotland fell between 1929 and 1939.
