The whole course of the negotiations which culminated in the marriage agreement, called the Treaty of Birgham, shows the guardians above all anxious to do nothing that might impair the “rights” or the integrity of Scotland.
The Treaty of Birgham was the high-watermark of the endeavour by the Guardians and the community. The treaty envisaged two feudal kingdoms, England and Scotland ruled separately though in harmony by a king and queen. The Scottish kingdom was to remain, as the Scots had demanded, free and without subjugation. Elections to the clergy in Scotland were to be free of external interference and tenants-in- chief of the Scots Crown need do homage for their lands in Scotland only, persons in Scotland who had been accused of a crime or sued at law should not have to answer in a court outside their country.
The treaty has been praised as a document of wise statesmanship and patriotism, but it was also something else. It was essentially a cautious, protective document.
