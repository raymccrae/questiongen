King John must have feared the danger from within his borders from disappointed Scottish nobles who preferred to side with the English King, this of course included the Bruces. For Edward in early 1296 the campaign to Scotland was carried out from the outset by using the full force of Englandâ€™s experienced army. On 30 March his large army made a swift example of the town of Berwick, slaughtering over 7000 inhabitants. When a small Scottish force attempted to relieve the besieged castle of Dunbar, King John was absent. In the ensuing battle at Dunbar on 27 April the Scots were defeated resoundingly by a small English force led by Surrey. Edward then progressed north unhindered. The Scots leaders soon lost all stomach for the fight.
