Having considered the peace and tranquillity of both kingdoms and in doing so mutual friendship should continue between our peoples for all time, we have granted in the name of our lord (Edward I) that the rights and liberties and customs of Scotland shall be wholly preserved. We promise that the kingdom of Scotland shall remain separate and divided from the kingdom of England by rightful boundaries and borders as has been observed up to now and that it shall be free and independent.
We grant that no tenant-in-chief of the king of Scotland shall be forced to go outside the kingdom to do homage or fealty or to pay relief for his lands. No parliament shall be held outwith the kingdom and borders of Scotland on matters concerning that kingdom or its borders or the position of those that live in the kingdom. No one of the kingdom of Scotland shall be held to answer outwith that kingdom for any agreement entered into, or for any crime committed, or in any other cause contrary to the laws and customs of that kingdom.
