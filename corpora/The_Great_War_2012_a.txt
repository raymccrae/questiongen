The situation at Hill 70 was serious. A third time the order was given to attack that awful hillside, but the enemy with his reserves at hand, were too many for us and again we fell back, truly we were holding to the motto of the regiment “A Cameron never can yield”. We numbered at this stage less than 100 and for all we knew might be all that was left of 6th Cameron Highlanders. As the evening drew on we made a fourth and final attempt to win and hold the ridge. This time we meant to do or die. To the sound of the pipes and led by our brave old colonel, bareheaded and with no other weapon than his walking stick, we made for the top of Hill 70 through murderous rifle and machine gun fire, while shells crashed all around us. We made the top but now we were desperate for the promised reinforcements but no help could we see.
