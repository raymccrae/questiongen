I have not the slightest hesitation in declaring, that it appears to me as plain as the sun at noonday, that a farmer in Scotland, occupying a farm that does not pay him, distressed as he must be, struggling from morning to night with mental anxiety and worry pressing upon his mind and yet after all quite unable to support his family or better their circumstancesâ€”I say that a farmer continuing to remain in Scotland even when unemployed while so much land lies in Canada to occupy, acts the part of an insane person. In a short time there will be no cheap land to be procured about these parts. The best way for my brothers to lay out their money here in Canada is in buying land which is every year rising in value.
