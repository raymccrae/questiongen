By seven-forty the two assaulting brigades of the 15th Division had left the trenches and were in the open. Shriller than the scream of shells above them was the skirl of pipes, going with them. The orders of the Scottish troops, which I saw, were to go “all out,” and to press onto Hill 70, with the absolute assurance that all the ground they gained would be held behind them by supporting troops. With the promise of reinforcements to follow, they trudged on to Hill 70. For a time there was a kind of Bank Holiday crowd on Hill 70. The German machine gunners, knowing that the redoubt on the crest was still held by their men, initially dared not fire. Then the quiet of Hill 70 was broken by the beginning of a new bombardment from German guns. “Dig in,” said the officers. “We must hold on at all costs until the reinforcements come up.” None came and they were forced to withdraw.
