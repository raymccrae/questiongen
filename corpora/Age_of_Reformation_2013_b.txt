The matter is horrible and so strange. This last night 9th February, a little after two hours after midnight, the house in which the King was lodged was in an instant blown in the air, whilst he was lying sleeping in his bed, with such force, that of the whole lodging there is nothing remaining. It must have been done by force of gunpowder and appears to have been a mine. It is not yet known who carried out this deed and in what manner. At any rate whoever has taken this wicked enterprise in hand, we believe it was intended for us as well as for the King; for we lay the most part of the last week in the same lodging, and were there attended by the lords that were in town that same night at midnight. It was only by chance that we did not stay the night, by reason of some masque in the abbey (of Holyrood); but we believe it was not a chance, but that God put it in our head.
