Meeting at Perth, according to his Majesty’s request, and concerning the articles proposed by the King. The brethren, after long conference and mature deliberation agree as follows: The Assembly ordains that no minister shall criticise his Majesty’s laws but should seek remedy from his Presbytery, Synod or General Assembly which will present his complaints to his Majesty and report on his Majesty’s answer. No man’s name should be rebuked from the pulpit, unless his fault be well known and in public. Every Presbytery should watch that each minister’s doctrine is agreeable with God’s word. No meetings should be held by ministers without his Majesty’s knowledge and consent, apart from the Kirk Session, Presbytery and Synod meetings. In all principal towns ministers should not be chosen without the consent of their own flock and his Majesty.
