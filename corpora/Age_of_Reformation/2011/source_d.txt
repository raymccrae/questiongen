A general assembly met in February at Perth and not, as the previous assembly had appointed, in April at St Andrews. This set the pattern for the years to come. It was hard to raise objections if the king chose to bring forward the date of the assembly, but when his right to do this was admitted it was equally hard to challenge his right to postpone an assembly. It was equally hard to challenge the kingâ€™s power to name the place of meeting, and year by year he showed a plain reluctance to have an assembly either in Edinburgh or St Andrews, and had preference for towns more easily accessible to ministers from the more traditional north. The assembly of 1597 conceded that ministers should not be appointed in the chief towns without the consent of the king, and passed various measures curbing the freedom of ministers in the course of their sermons, to attack the laws, to censure individuals and comment on politics.
