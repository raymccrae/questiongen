In the Reformed church, ministers must be educated and godly and appointed following election, examination and admission. If a minister does not look after his congregation he should be punished. The Church of God cannot exist without discipline. For faults such as drunkenness, fighting and common swearing, the offender must be called before the minister, elders and deacons and admit to his sin. Individuals who accept discipline must appear before the whole church to repent, before being received again into the society of the church. Every year individuals must stand before their minister and elders to give confession to their faith, rehearse the Commandments of the Law with the Lordâ€™s Prayer and declare their understanding in those things. All persons should be encouraged to learn the Psalms and when the Psalms are sung, they may be the more able with common heart and voice to praise God.
