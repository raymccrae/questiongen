The strikers were being addressed by the Strike Committee until their leaders returned from meeting the Lord Provost. The strike leaders were kept waiting in the City Chambers and the police were ordered to draw their batons and forcibly disperse the crowd waiting in George Square. On hearing the sounds of conflict the strike leaders rushed out to help restore order with Willie Gallacher (of the Clyde Workers’ Committee) urging the crowd to disperse peacefully. But, instead of listening, the police made an attack on them and Davie Kirkwood (of the Clyde Workers’ Committee) was thrown to the ground. The outrage looks like a prearranged affair with the attack on the strikers being deliberately planned and ordered. The government, afraid to do their own dirty work, employed the police to do it for them. This was sheer brutality by the police and January 31st 1919 will be known in Glasgow as Bloody Friday.
