At Edinburgh on 6 July 1560 the following terms are agreed between France and England. All military forces of each party shall withdraw from the realm of Scotland, and all warlike operations in England, Ireland and Wales shall entirely cease. And since the realms of England and Ireland belong by right to Queen Elizabeth, no other is allowed to call, write, name or have himself called, written or named king or queen of England or Ireland. Nor is anyone to use the signs and arms of those kingdoms. It is therefore agreed that the most Christian King Francis and Queen Mary shall abstain from using or carrying the said title or arms of the kingdom of England or Ireland. And King Francis and Queen Mary will fulfil all those things which were granted by their representatives to the nobility and people of Scotland provided that the nobility and people of Scotland fulfil and observe what was contained in those conventions and articles.
