Undeniably, as a result of union, Scotland was faced with an increased tax burden after 1707, most notoriously in 1711 with the salt and linen taxes. Customs records show increasing amounts of cases of intimidation and violent assaults on customs officers. Nevertheless, the possibilities of union were fundamental, presenting the Scottish landed elites with a golden opportunity. The benefit of English naval protection for trade with America was obvious. Employment of Scots in colonial trade became a crucial lifeline. In the decades after union, streams of eager Caledonians from impoverished backgrounds poured into British colonies at every point from Canada to Bengal. Career openings were greater than before and Scots were very keen to exploit them.
