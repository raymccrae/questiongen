With around twenty-five Squadrone MPs, the government could carry the union, and did. Squadrone votes proved critical in securing approval for several of the articles which, had they been defeated, would have brought the union process to a shuddering halt. In part the Court’s success was achieved by political management, which was to spur court-minded MPs into attending and voting for a cause many were at best sympathetic to, and only in a few cases seriously enthusiastic about. There were MPs however who voted consistently for the articles without benefiting at all from the Equivalent—eight of these were associated with the Squadrone. If the purpose of the Equivalent had been to bribe MPs, the outcome was disappointing. Support for union depended on much more than material gain.
