Since the Union of the Crowns in 1603, and in a hundred years of joint monarchy with England, the Scots had been very sensitive to the sinking economic condition of their nation. Also, they were aware of the visible damage both to trade and to the wealth of the inhabitants of the country. This was plainly owing to the loss of Scottish ministersâ€™ presence at Court in London, the disadvantages of tariffs and the influence the English had over their kings. It was just as plain that one way for the Scots to restore themselves was in terms of incorporating union and alliance with England. There would be advantages for Scottish commerce of free access to English and empire markets. Without incorporating union, the Scottish economy would remain unstable. It was either union, or a return back to their separate self-existing state.
