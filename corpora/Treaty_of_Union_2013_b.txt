As the terms of the treaty became known in November, there was an impressive reaction from all over the country, with a flood of Addresses to parliament from shires, Royal Burghs and parishes and all social classes. All of those Addresses were strongly opposed to the union and there was none in favour. This was a remarkable and unprecedented event which should be celebrated as a milestone in political history. There had been no previous instance of such a unanimous, peaceful and rational expression of the views of the people on an important political issue. It showed the strength of national feeling and widespread literacy and awareness of the issues in the union debate. The Addresses protested against the union as “contrary to the honour and independence of the Kingdom”. This is especially remarkable at a time when democracy did not exist in any state and when it was widely held that people who were not landowners or Members of Parliament had no right to express views on matters of government policy.
