A certain Scot, by name William Wallace was an outcast from pity, a robber, a sacrilegious man, a man who burnt alive boys in schools and churches in great numbers. Wallace had collected an army of Scots in the battle of Falkirk against the King of England, and had seen that he could not resist the powerful army of the King, and so fled himself from the battle, leaving his people to be slain by the sword. This man, after his innumerable wickednesses, was at last taken prisoner by the Kingâ€™s servants and brought to London, as the King ordained that he should be formally tried. He was put to a most cruel, but amply deserved, death. His head was fixed on a stake and set on London Bridge. His four quarters thus divided, were sent to the four quarters of Scotland. Behold the end of a merciless man whom his mercilessness brought to this end.
