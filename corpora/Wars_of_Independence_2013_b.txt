In March 1296, the King of England, being strongly stirred up, marched in person, with a large force, on Scotland. Upon the town of Berwick, sparing neither sex nor age, the aforesaid King of England, put to the sword some 7500 souls. On 27 April, in the same year, was fought the battle of Dunbar, where Patrick of Graham and many Scottish nobles fell wounded in defeat, while a great many other knights fled to Dunbar Castle. However, up to 70 of them, including William, Earl of Ross, were betrayed by the warden of the castle and handed over to the King of England, like sheep offered to the slaughter. In this, Balliol’s war, all the supporters of Bruce’s party were generally considered traitors to their King and country.
