Robert Bruce had no wish to prolong the war. He saw his victory, above all, as an opportunity for reconciliation and peace: with the Scottish nobles who had fought against him, with the English whom he had defeated. Soon after Bannockburn many Scottish barons and knights who had served under the two Edwards offered to him their allegiance and were received into his peace. In November 1314 Bruce with increased confidence, convened a Parliament at Cambuskenneth. The Parliament adjudged that all Scottish landowners who had failed to offer allegiance by that date should be disinherited. His sole aim was that those who wished to regain their Scottish lands must do homage to him alone. They could no longer be feudatories in two countries and serve two kings. They must choose their nationality once and for all.
