Scots responded in great numbers to the call to arms at the outbreak of war in 1914 and by December 1914, 25% of the male labour force of western Scotland had signed up. However it was being reported throughout the press from as early as October that the numbers enlisting were falling slightly. It seemed, according to the editors of Forward that “the Cannon fodder was rather backward in coming forward”. There was a serious side to this issue as even a slight fall in recruitment meant that the topic of conscription was raised. If matters had been left to the Scottish press the decision to introduce compulsory military service would have been a foregone conclusion. The Glasgow Herald reported in December 1914 that if voluntarism did not work then conscription was the only alternative. The Daily Record ran similar articles promoting support for conscription. Despite the National Registration Act, recruitment levels fell to around 80,000 per month by January 1916 and conscription became a reality.
