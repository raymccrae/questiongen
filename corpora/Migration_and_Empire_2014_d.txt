For a time Dundee could boast the title Juteopolis, the jute capital of the world, exporting to the world and especially the Empire. World demand for the linen and jute textiles made in Dundee rose sharply in the 19th century. As world trade with the Empire expanded so did demand for jute sacks for corn, wool, fertilisers and other bulk goods. By the 1860s the Camperdown factory at Lochee was the world’s largest jute factory. These were great days for the city’s jute and linen barons such as the Baxter Brothers and the Gilroys. They made great fortunes from the growing trade, some of which were devoted to the construction of big mansions on the outskirts of the city in West Ferry and Broughty Ferry. Their money was also used to purchase great country estates further away from Dundee. Although jute imports peaked in 1902 the profit levels of the 1860s were never matched. Competition was growing from Indian jute mills. The First World War brought a temporary boom to Dundee’s jute mills but after the war the advantages of Empire trade that had made Dundee boom now deserted the town.
