In the 1690s Scotland was tipped over the edge of an economic abyss that was to have profound political consequences for the nation’s history. Factors included a series of harvest failures and the effects of England’s war with Scotland’s ally France, particularly the damaging loss of French trade. The erection of protective tariffs by countries overseas blocked the export of certain Scottish goods. Finally, there was the disaster of Darien, Scotland’s ambitious scheme to establish a colony in South America. As it happened, the outcome—eventually—was incorporating union with England, but the decade of crisis might equally have produced a very different result.
