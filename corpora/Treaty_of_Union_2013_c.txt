Ninety-plus Addresses against the union streamed into parliament over a period of just over eight weeks from the beginning of November. The similarity of much of the language in most of the Addresses suggests they were the result of a campaign by the Country party. Yet what is striking is that the very act of signing the Addresses indicates that the signatories had common concerns. The Addresses spoke in defence of Scotland’s honour and independent sovereignty, as embodied in its parliament and the “fundamental laws and constitution of this kingdom”. The Addresses reveal not only how widespread public opposition to union was but also much about its nature. Signatures were made on behalf of the illiterate, so we cannot be sure that those represented in the Addresses were fully aware of what was being said about the union on their behalf.
