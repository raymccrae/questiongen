The year 1560 is one of the most famous milestones in Scottish history, because things could begin to change. However, the parish churches which emerged from the Reformation achieved much of what had been aimed for in the early 1560s in preaching, worship, ministry and discipline. Protestant ministers appointed to parishes were well educated, enjoyed career stability and were only rarely disciplined for any moral failings. Ministers and elders imposed a strict programme of discipline for minor offences such as drunkenness and there was surprisingly little hostility to this. Evidence suggests that people accepted the need for this disciplinary system even though they were not always so content when they were the ones to have offended. There are also signs of a strong religious culture, and the role of psalm, prayer and in some cases poetry and song were important in spreading Protestant doctrines and values.
