The Irish have been driven by the increasing poverty in their own country to emigrate to Scotland. By their hard work railways have been formed and new and important sources of wealth opened up. However, the Irish, during the past ten years, have absolutely inundated this country. They have also swallowed up our rapidly increasing Poor Rates, have directed charity away from its proper channels, and have filled our jails. By their greatest numbers they have lessened wages or totally deprived thousands of the working people of Scotland of that employment which legitimately belonged to them. Lastly, there can be no doubt that their contact with the Scotch has not been for the benefit morally or intellectually of the latter. Let us redouble our efforts not to keep Scotland for the Scotch, for that is impossible; but to keep Scotlandâ€” Scotch!
