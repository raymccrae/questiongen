Few battles in history are truly decisive, and Bannockburn was no exception. The war was nowhere near an end, the military campaign would continue, despite Bruce’s hopes for peace. However, in the November, after the battle, Bruce was ready to take the next step. The Scots Parliament met at Cambuskenneth Abbey. The Parliament passed sentence that all who held land in Scotland, but continued to fight against the King, would lose their lands. Landowners could no longer have divided political loyalties: they had to choose one side or the other. The new class of the “disinherited” were men on the English side, usually with Comyn and Balliol associations, who refused to accept the new realities; men in other words, who wished to remain loyal to the King of England but continue to hold estates and titles in Scotland.
