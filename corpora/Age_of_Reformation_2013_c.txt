In the aftermath of Darnley’s death there was much speculation as to who was implicated in the murder and how exactly it was carried out. During the two years after his murder, two people were formally accused of it. These two people were the Earl of Bothwell and the Queen herself. While the Protestant Lords disliked Darnley, they may have seen the murder as an opportunity to rid themselves of another person who posed a threat, namely Bothwell. The Lords of the Council concluded that the Old Provost’s Lodging and the Prebendaries’ Chamber had been blown into the air by the force of the powder. However, the whole matter remains a mystery. Why would Bothwell or anyone else choose to kill Darnley using gunpowder, instead of poison or suffocation? In addition, from about 4pm until Mary returned to Holyrood around midnight, Bothwell was in attendance on her, and conspicuously dressed in a masquing costume. It is very unlikely that, bent on murder, he made himself so visible by walking in his rich attire up and down the Canongate.
