By 1928 the story in Scotland was one of general economic decline. Between 1921 and 1923 shipbuilding on the Clyde dropped from 500,000 tons to 170,000 mainly as a result of cancellations but the Clyde was already beginning to pay for the artificial boom which had rescued it during the war years. On January 5 the unthinkable happened when the last ship to be built at Beardmore’s left the Clyde and the shipyard at Dalmuir was put up for sale. Coal production suffered as a result of falling international markets, especially in Eastern Europe, and the same fate for the same reason hit the fishing industry. Jute production in Dundee was adversely affected by declining orders, shrinking markets and workers’ strikes. In 1921 a census carried out by the Board of Agriculture showed the number of male farm workers had fallen a great deal. According to the Board’s findings the decline was not restricted to any particular part of the country but was widespread throughout Scotland. Soon machine age farming would change the face of farming forever.
