A gentleman who thirteen years ago was a draper’s assistant in Scotland now owns the finest retail business in Dunedin, employs fifty hands and pays £250 weekly in wages. The enterprise of the Dunedin merchants has done much for the commerce and prosperity of Otago. The Scot has certainly made his mark on this land, not only in commerce but also in the field of education, setting up schools throughout the area. Several of the Scots’ descendants have also become doctors, administering to the health of the local population in a most efficient manner. In 1862, another born Scot from Edinburgh, arrived in Dunedin to conduct a geological survey of Otago and three years later he was appointed to found the Geological Survey of New Zealand, managing New Zealand’s premier scientific society. It must be stated, however, that not all of the emigrants have made their presence a wholly welcome one in this land. Thankfully, this type of immigrant is far from common-place.
