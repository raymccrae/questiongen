We are of the opinion that evils said to arise from Irish immigration have been considerably magnified. However, the wave of Irish immigration that washes over us each year should be restricted and this principally because the Catholic Irish who invade us are of a class which interferes materially with the wants and needs of the labouring poor, particularly in their dependence on adequate funds within the Poor Rates. In general, our own poor are far superior to the newcomers in point of sober and moral habits. We have no doubt that the work of this parish could be done, and the harvest got in, without the competition from Irish labourers whose presence forces down the wages to be earned from this work.
