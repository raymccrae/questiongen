Great interest is being taken in the scheme of the Ontario government to emigrate young men and women between 18 and 23 to Canada. The Ontario agent finds that he could treble the number he is authorised to enlist owing no doubt to the depressed state of trade in Lewis, the lack of employment generally and the inability of the farmers to satisfy the hunger of the families. Immediately on landing, employment will be found for farmers and the women can find employment in domestic work. The pay is good as experienced men can at the very start earn £5 to £6 per month. The men also have the prospect of becoming owners of their own farms once again.
